Python2.7 code utilizing scikit-learn, pandas, and numpy modules for comapring multiple supervised machine learning algorithms on pandas data frames as an input. Note, none of the algorithms are tuned except the random forest (Ntree ~ 400) and SVM is only tuned by kernel type (linear) for the data generated by randomData.py. Algorithms should be tuned to the input data set. 

randomData.py: Generates data frame containing 2*6 (positive and negative set) random features for binary classification. Data is split into 75% training and 25% testing sets.

mlCodeRandomDataCompare.py: Compares 12 supervised learning algorithms based on several metrics and computes the average of 6 metrics with a range from 0 to 1. Plots ROC and PrecisionRecall curves in 2 figures and plots histogram of importance for RandomForest and GradientBoosted models.

mlCodeRandomDataPlots.py: Plots the importance of features for a given algorithm. Plots 2D for each feature and 3D for 2 chosen features.
